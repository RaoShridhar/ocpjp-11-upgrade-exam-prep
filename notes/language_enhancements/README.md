### Language Enhancements

#### Java Language Changes for Java SE 11

Java SE 11 lets you declare formal parameters of implicitly typed lambda expressions with the var identifier; 
see [Create and use lambda expressions with local-variable type inferred parameters](../local_variable_type_inference/create_and_use_lambda_expressions_with_local_variable_type_inferred_parameters.md)

#### Java Language Changes for Java SE 10

Java SE 10 introduces support for inferring the type of local variables from the context, 
which makes code more readable and reduces the amount of required boilerplate code.
See [Use local-variable type inference](../local_variable_type_inference/use_local_variable_type_inference.md)

#### Java Language Changes for Java SE 9

The major change to Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) 9 is the introduction of the Java Platform module system. 
See [Understanding Modules](../understanding_modules)
Apart from the new module system, a few changes have been made to the Java language including the more concise 
try-with-resources statements See [Use try-with-resources construct](use_try_with_resources_construct.md)

The underscore character is not a legal name.
If you use the underscore character ("_") an identifier, your source code can no longer be compiled.

Private interface methods are supported.
Private interface methods are supported. This support allows non-abstract methods of an interface to share code 
between them. See [Create and use methods in interfaces](../java_interfaces/create_and_use_methods_in_interfaces.md)
